[German](https://github.com/Agent-Husky/OpenComputers/tree/master/Smart%20Home%20Automation/Programs/Deutsch) <br>

#### You are missing your language?
You can edit the buttons to display the texts in your language. <br>
There is a Tutorial on how to do this [here](). <br>
If you want, you can send me a pull request with your edited file to make it public to other people. <br>
PS: I don't want any texts translated by Google. <br>

### How to install
If you want to install this program in your Minecraft world, make sure that you got OpenOS, an Internet Card, a Network Card and a Tier 3 Gpu installed. <br>
Then run the installer by typing in the following command:
>wget -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ /home/installer.lua

PS: Note that if you are using Tablets, the colors wont be as good as with the Remote Console (Tier 3 Tablets use Tier 2 Screens) connected to Servers and you will need to use Wireless Network Cards in your Tablets and your Main Server.

### Tips and Tricks
If u want the program to autostart after you turned on the computer, you have to edit the profile.lua file in the <i><b>etc</b></i> directory. <br>
To edit the file while you are in the home directory type:
> edit /etc/profile.lua <br> 
<br>

There delete the line:
>dofile("/etc/motd") <br>
<br>

And add the line:
>os.execute(path to your file f.e. "/home/Smart Server.lua")

<br>
