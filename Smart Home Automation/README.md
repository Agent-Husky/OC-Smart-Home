### Tips and Tricks
If u want the program to autostart after you turned on the computer, you have to edit the profile.lua file in the <i><b>etc</b></i> directory.
To edit the file while you are in the home directory type:
> edit /etc/profile.lua <br> 
<br>

There delete the line:
>dofile("/etc/motd") <br>
<br>

And add the line:
>os.execute(path to your file f.e. "/home/Smart Server")

<br>
